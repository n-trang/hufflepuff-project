# Hufflepuff Project - A Python Testing Project
I studied the course [Automated Software Testing](https://trang17.github.io/automated-software-testing/). And though the course is great, its excersises are in Java - the programing language that I know absolutely nothing about.

The good news is that the codes are very readable - I can understand what they do, I just don't know how to write the codes.

Granted the codes are quite simple, I think to rewrite it in Python - the language I'm more confident with, will do good.

As this is a Software testing course, not Java programing course after all. And all the testing ideas and concepts carry on no matter the language.

## What I learnt
### Partition and equivalence partitioning.
- `2-1-leap-year.py`
- We need to do this.
### Boundary testing.

### Structure testing and code coverage.
